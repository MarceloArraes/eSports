## Search for your duo!

A three way project with mobile (react-native), local server (sqlite, prisma, nodejs, express) and web (reactjs, typescript, radix, axios).
With this web-app you can share and get a Duo to play online games, and connect using the Discord nicknames.

# Next steps for the project:

- responsiveness for mobile view of the web. (using keen-slider)
- use Radix to remake the select
- make a validation to form, with notification on the fields(using react-hook-form/ZOD)
- Deploy web on some online deploy like cyclic
- use a online database.
- Deploy server and web.
- Update this project into my portfolio.
